1
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,844
Elizabeth.

2
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,283
Who are you?

3
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,185
How did you get in?

4
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,723
Do exactly as I say. Come here.

5
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,901
Unless you want me to go to Frankie's bedroom.

6
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:10,807
Did you understand...

7
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,642
what I said?

8
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,310
Put it down.

9
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:17,379
Now.

10
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,947
There you go.

11
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:20,950
Adam...

12
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,699
What do you want from us?

13
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,269
Just swallow these.

14
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,942
- Uh-huh. - No. No.

15
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,443
Adam.

16
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:54,617
Are you listening to me?

17
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:57,352
Are you listening to me?

18
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:00,355
Hear this.

19
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,293
You can swallow these...

20
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,797
or I can go down the hall...

21
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:10,767
and visit your son Frankie.

22
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,671
Understand?

23
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:41,695
You wanna make this easier, or...

24
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,871
There you go.

25
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,634
Almost through.

26
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:36,819
I count four more.

27
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:39,722
One.

28
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,759
Down it goes.

29
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,561
Two.

30
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,834
Three.

31
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,590
There.

32
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:17,994
That wasn't too hard, was it?

33
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:18,187
Frankie... you lucky boy.

34
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,159
Shh.

35
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,530
Blade.

36
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,325
We shouldn't be here, Jeff.

37
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:06,693
Jesus, Kelly. We've been over this ten times already.

38
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,963
Yeah, I know. But your theory is holding on by a fucking thread.

39
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,865
No wonder Captain Martel ignored your request for...

40
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,367
Captain Martel is gonna be retired,

41
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,968
so he can't hold out on us in less than a month.

42
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,005
I'm not gonna bet our future on him.

43
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,315
Who is it?

44
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:31,018
LAPD. Just wanna ask you a few questions.

45
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,086
Told you he was here.

46
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:54,775
What're you doing? I'll fucking kill you!

47
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,745
Oh, yeah?

48
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,752
All right. I'll drop you off first,

49
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,056
and then I'll take this sweetheart in.

50
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,756
Tomorrow's a big day.

51
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,191
You need your beauty sleep.

52
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:12,759
Put your head down.

53
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,094
You sure you don't want my help?

54
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,263
No, I'm good. Thank you... Captain.

55
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,832
Hey, don't jinx it. And listen, do me a favor.

56
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,003
Liz wants me to get home safe tonight, so I'm gonna drive.

57
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,871
All right.

58
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,040
- Thank you. - Mmm-hmm.

59
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:52,835
Careful.

60
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,320
- Hey, buddy. - I had a nightmare.

61
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,056
That's no good. Come here.

62
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,324
You okay?

63
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:53,195
I dreamt a bad guy came to my room.

64
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,395
A bad guy?

65
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,130
Okay, well, I can promise you

66
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:59,969
that there are no bad guys in your room, okay?

67
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,273
What do you think that is?

68
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:08,375
Mommy made you a surprise.

69
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,776
She did?

70
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,147
Well, if it's a surprise, you're not supposed to tell me about it.

71
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:16,051
Okay, let's take a look at this.

72
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,960
"I'm so proud of you."

73
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,204
It's beautiful.

74
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:37,239
So bright.

75
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:40,907
Hey.

76
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,176
Let's not tell Mommy you told me, all right?

77
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:44,911
- I promise. - Okay, good.

78
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,614
Now, come here. Let me get you to bed.

79
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,382
Let's go find Mommy.

80
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:49,983
Where's Mommy, hmm?

81
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:51,619
Where'd she go? Is she hiding on us?

82
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,822
Where is she?

83
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:57,459
Maybe she's in the living room.

84
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:01,194
Nope, not in here.

85
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:02,464
Let's go check the bedroom.

86
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,907
Oh, where could she be?

87
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,955
Is she in here?

88
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:40,901
Oh, my...

89
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,104
What is it?

90
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,344
Nothing, buddy. She's not here.

91
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,547
Okay, Frankie. Listen to me for a second.

92
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:55,515
I need you to go to sleep for me.

93
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,853
Right now, okay? Okay.

94
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:05,829
Liz. Liz.

95
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:39,219
We have a Code 1056

96
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,088
at 10622 Magnolia Boulevard.

97
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,845
Hey, guys, let me see the body?

98
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:40,280
- For a second. - Yeah, sure thing, Detective.

99
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,155
I guess his new tie didn't fit right?

100
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:52,325
Come here a second. I... I don't know if I heard you right.

101
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,295
Say it again. Huh? Is this a fucking joke to you?

102
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,732
- Hey, man. I was just... - Hey, Detective! That's enough!

103
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,466
That's enough!

104
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,167
Okay.

105
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,138
- With all due respect, sir... - I'm good.

106
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,642
I'm good.

107
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,880
What's his problem?

108
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:15,650
His wife killed herself three months ago.

109
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,320
He's been prowling 1056s ever since.

110
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:20,389
What's 1056?

111
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,457
Suicide scenes.

112
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,459
Oh, Christ, poor dude.

113
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,795
Yeah, well...

114
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,364
Just take care of the body.

115
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,581
You asked to see me, Your Highness?

116
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,416
Don't call me that. I didn't steal your job.

117
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,718
I took the damn job

118
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,254
because you threw it down the toilet.

119
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,425
Two more men filed reports against you.

120
00:16:58,795 --> 00:16:59,796
Oh, yeah?

121
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,731
Uh, which two?

122
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:04,801
They call you "The Suicide Guy," Jeff.

123
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,303
What do you want me to say?

124
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:10,871
Look.

125
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:12,572
All you've been doing since it happened

126
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,908
is skulk around suicide scenes.

127
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,546
It doesn't make any sense, and I won't condone it any longer.

128
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,347
You've gotta get back in the saddle.

129
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,182
Let me team you up with a new partner,

130
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:24,217
assign you to a homicide case.

131
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:26,321
You have a gift, Jeff. Don't waste it.

132
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,491
I am working a homicide case.

133
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,227
- Elizabeth took her own life. - No.

134
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,629
She didn't.

135
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:35,963
We've been through this a hundred times...

136
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,832
She didn't have a single reason to kill herself.

137
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,836
You know that. That's not who she was.

138
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,470
With all the respect I have for her,

139
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,706
her work as an artist was very tormented.

140
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,810
- We don't know what was going on... - No, I know!

141
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,317
She was my wife.

142
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:58,253
She was my best friend, so I know.

143
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,625
And what about Frankie, hmm?

144
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,259
I mean, what he said that night, the nightmare he had.

145
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:09,396
A man in his room. Do you think he made that shit up?

146
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,297
And the two guys that I saw on the way in that night.

147
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,000
I asked everybody in the fucking building,

148
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:14,236
nobody knows who they are.

149
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:17,607
This is shady.

150
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:20,308
It's not shady...

151
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:22,377
it's crazy.

152
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,453
Okay.

153
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,748
Freeze! Put your hands in the air.

154
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,285
You got me, buddy. Come here.

155
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:12,853
- Oh... - I heard the shower

156
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,455
- and knew it was you. - Oh, you're always right.

157
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:16,556
Can you come play?

158
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,894
Yeah. Let me just talk to Grandma first, okay?

159
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:22,930
- And then we can play. - Yay!

160
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,332
I'll be right back, all right?

161
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,811
Hey, Mom.

162
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,013
Hi.

163
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,350
We haven't seen you in a while.

164
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,494
At least you took a shower.

165
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,164
Yeah.

166
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,068
You're still not going back to that apartment?

167
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,503
No, I can't.

168
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:04,807
Well, then sell the damn thing and move on.

169
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:10,711
This is a terrible example for your son!

170
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:12,913
You cannot keep coming back here like this.

171
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,480
Look, Frankie...

172
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,819
He's a kid, okay? He doesn't notice stuff like this.

173
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,019
Oh, he doesn't?

174
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,921
That's how little you know about your son.

175
00:21:20,923 --> 00:21:22,424
He notices everything!

176
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:25,491
And besides...

177
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,095
- I notice, Jeff. - Well, you're my mother.

178
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:30,496
And you understand what I'm going through, right?

179
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,600
Two months ago, I understood.

180
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:34,935
Now it is just self-destruction.

181
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:36,538
I need one thing from you, Mom.

182
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:39,141
Be there for Frankie.

183
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,677
I can't be, not yet.

184
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:45,447
You won't bring her back by killing yourself.

185
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,084
There.

186
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,153
I said it.

187
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,390
Yeah. You said it.

188
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,164
Are you okay, Dad?

189
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:37,900
Yeah, buddy.

190
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:39,501
I'm good.

191
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,113
I love you. You know that, right?

192
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:53,448
Give me a hug. Come on.

193
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:54,817
Yeah.

194
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,219
I gotta go, okay?

195
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:31,618
- Anderson. - Jeff, it's Capt... It's Kelly.

196
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,855
You gotta get to the hospital.

197
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:34,489
Now.

198
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,157
Kelly, what's going on?

199
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,061
Get moving. I'll brief you on the way.

200
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:37,987
Miss Wilson?

201
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:43,125
I'm Detective Jeff Anderson, LAPD.

202
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:47,694
I know you're going through something...

203
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,931
unimaginable right now.

204
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,667
I already, uh, told everything to your colleagues.

205
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:56,138
But I need to hear firsthand what happened to you.

206
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:58,607
In your own words.

207
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:05,915
Um, my boyfriend, Mike,

208
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,984
had left to go home.

209
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:13,923
I heard the apartment door, and...

210
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,859
I thought maybe it was him.

211
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,128
Maybe he forgot something.

212
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,201
But then, two guys...

213
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:27,336
came in...

214
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,738
A...

215
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,942
The older one's...

216
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:34,977
in his 60s.

217
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:37,713
And...

218
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:43,085
He looked like he hated my guts.

219
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,193
The younger guy was in his 20s...

220
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,062
and he had a gun.

221
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:57,333
A...

222
00:25:58,234 --> 00:25:59,335
Older guy...

223
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:04,006
handed me a bottle of sleeping pills.

224
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:07,810
And...

225
00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:10,679
He, uh...

226
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:12,948
told me, uh...

227
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,784
"Take them."

228
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,355
'Cause he knew where my mother lived.

229
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,434
And then...

230
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,138
Mike did forget something.

231
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,746
And then, uh,

232
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:47,082
the next thing I remember is...

233
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,118
waking up in this room.

234
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:55,024
Where is Mike?

235
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,194
A...

236
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,795
- This wasn't... - I'm Jane.

237
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:03,232
So, call... Call me Jane.

238
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,800
Jane...

239
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,704
No.

240
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:13,774
No, don't say it. Don't.

241
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:15,444
- Don't say it. - They shot him.

242
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:21,083
He didn't make it.

243
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,356
I'm sorry.

244
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:55,082
-Jeff...-No.

245
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:56,483
I don't know what to say. This is...

246
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:58,420
No, this is exactly what I've been saying for the last six months!

247
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,058
Look...

248
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,063
You understand what I have to do, right?

249
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:10,499
I do.

250
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:27,516
- Where's it at? - Upstairs.

251
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:01,817
They started here...

252
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:04,219
and there.

253
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,253
- Yeah. - Daddy?

254
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,723
Frankie, hey.

255
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:38,291
Hey, buddy. What're you doing? Is Grandma with you?

256
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:41,328
Are we still going to Disneyland?

257
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,630
No, buddy. I'm sorry.

258
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:44,665
I totally forgot about that.

259
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,800
Can we go tomorrow?

260
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:48,636
No, no, no, no. Daddy's got a lot of work right now.

261
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:50,740
Are you looking for a bad guy?

262
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:53,674
Two of 'em, actually.

263
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:55,444
What did they do?

264
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,580
They did some bad things.

265
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:00,948
Did they kill Mom?

266
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,184
Frankie.

267
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:04,184
Let Granny have the phone.

268
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:07,657
I'll talk to Daddy for a minute and you just go inside, okay?

269
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:09,491
Good boy.

270
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:15,328
Are you crazy?

271
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,797
Talking about this with your son?

272
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,565
Mom, hey.

273
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,534
Look, I didn't check my caller ID, he surprised me.

274
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:24,504
Frankie has been looking forward to going to Disneyland

275
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:26,539
with you today for weeks.

276
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,942
You promised him, Jeff!

277
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,777
Yeah, I know. Mom, Mom, look.

278
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:31,511
I'll make it up to him, I promise.

279
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:32,847
That's not how little boys think.

280
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:35,548
They need a father who they can trust

281
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,617
and who they can depend on,

282
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,588
not one that makes empty promises.

283
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,189
I got to go, Mom.

284
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:51,266
I miss you.

285
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:02,475
- What have you got? - I have a theory.

286
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,543
You always do.

287
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:06,246
I found 19 prominent women who committed suicide

288
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,381
by slashing their wrists in their bathtubs,

289
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,550
after ingesting sleeping pills.

290
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:11,854
All of them in the Los Angeles area.

291
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:14,791
And I only went back 10 years.

292
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:17,827
Guys, give me a second.

293
00:35:19,428 --> 00:35:20,861
What do you mean by "prominent women"?

294
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:24,497
Doctors, lawyers, artists, politicians, you name it.

295
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,267
Now, these women were featured prominently in the news

296
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:28,905
in the weeks preceding their suicides.

297
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:32,907
Are you saying all these women were murdered by our two suspects?

298
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:34,041
Probably not all of them.

299
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:36,476
- Okay, which ones then? - How the fuck should I know?

300
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:38,779
I mean, there's no crime scene, there's no evidence, nothing.

301
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:40,515
These guys are pros.

302
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:43,416
That's your theory?

303
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:46,687
Two men are simulating women suicides on a large scale.

304
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:48,555
Prominent women.

305
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:50,490
If your theory's correct, how come no one's ever noticed?

306
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:51,992
Kelly, I noticed...

307
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:54,795
and nobody believed me, but I understand that.

308
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:56,097
There's no apparent motives.

309
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,532
There's no clues. These are not even identified as murders.

310
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:02,939
And there are over a thousand suicides a year in this fucking town.

311
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,607
So these are perfect crimes?

312
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:07,877
As close as they get.

313
00:36:09,712 --> 00:36:10,845
What's their motive?

314
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,248
I don't know yet. But they hate women,

315
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:15,752
that's for sure.

316
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,386
Look, I need a team, Kelly.

317
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,957
There's way too much information to process, I need help.

318
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,092
Jeff, I can't do that sort of thing anymore.

319
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:28,929
It's not just you and me in a car in stakeout mode.

320
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:30,465
Okay. Right.

321
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:10,840
I hate you.

322
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,747
I hate you.

323
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:26,887
I hate you!

324
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:22,069
I came as soon as I could.

325
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:23,438
Thanks. Come in.

326
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:36,786
My God, Jeff.

327
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:38,652
What have you been doing?

328
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:40,788
I tried to think like they do,

329
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,692
and now I know how they operate.

330
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,820
And then they're gone.

331
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:13,889
Just like that.

332
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,091
Okay.

333
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:19,760
Let's just say your theory is accurate.

334
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:20,828
Mmm-hmm.

335
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,162
What do we do about it?

336
00:40:22,164 --> 00:40:24,031
Okay, look, I made a list

337
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,168
of the women that I would kill next if I was them.

338
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:29,937
- How'd you do all this? - I told you. Look at this shit!

339
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:31,772
- Are you kidding me? - Jeff.

340
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,040
For two weeks, I've been doing this.

341
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,608
Jeff, you are scaring me.

342
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,876
Look, it's fine. It's okay.

343
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:38,612
But these women need to be put into protective custody today.

344
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:40,014
Okay, well, you're asking for the impossible.

345
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:42,182
- Fuck you! - Do you know how much this would cost?

346
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:44,118
- Who cares how much it costs? - Putting a dozen women under

347
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,020
- constant police surveillance. - Yeah?

348
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:48,722
- And for how long? - Until they attack, Kelly!

349
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:50,824
Jeff, that could be a couple of months.

350
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,893
- Yeah. - If you're right.

351
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:54,328
No, I'm fucking right.

352
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,963
Look, believe me.

353
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:57,898
I would love nothing than to protect these women,

354
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,066
but this?

355
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:01,802
This represents thousands of man hours.

356
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:04,872
So many other cases would never be solved because of this!

357
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,807
Hey, this is your part of the fucking job!

358
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,710
- I didn't ask... - "Captain." No, you fucking stole it from me!

359
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,011
That's what happened.

360
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,049
- Let's be real for a second. - Okay, Jeff.

361
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,917
What am I supposed to tell the Commissioner?

362
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:20,621
That my former partner, who's barely showed up at the precinct

363
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:22,289
since his wife committed suicide

364
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,958
- six months ago... - Yeah.

365
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,127
...has developed a theory about two men

366
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:29,730
who are suiciding famous women?

367
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,233
That's not exactly how I would put it, no.

368
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:34,134
- We need proof. - Mmm-hmm.

369
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:35,636
- Jeff. - Mmm-hmm.

370
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:37,371
Concrete evidence...

371
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:39,840
that at least some of this is true.

372
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:42,376
These men don't leave evidence, Kelly!

373
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:43,911
What do you think I'm fucking telling you?

374
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:45,646
You're smarter than this.

375
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:47,848
They're fucking perfect at this!

376
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,118
Figure it out!

377
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:34,763
Don't let 'em catch you. Come on.

378
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:39,668
Get that boy! Get that boy right there.

379
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,270
Come on, you...

380
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:51,747
Look what the cat dragged in.

381
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:53,949
He looks happy.

382
00:42:57,887 --> 00:43:00,754
Well, today is a good day.

383
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:02,356
You know what I've been saying for months about Liz?

384
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:03,724
What, that she didn't kill herself?

385
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:04,925
I don't wanna talk about it.

386
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:06,295
- Mom, Mom, Mom. - No!

387
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:08,697
I was right.

388
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:11,400
And I can prove it now.

389
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:16,236
Are you serious?

390
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:20,676
Two men have been killing women... for years.

391
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:24,311
They killed Liz.

392
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:28,184
Oh, my God.

393
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,455
Are you sure?

394
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:38,959
How close are you to catching them?

395
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:41,828
Mom, I'm so fucking close.

396
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,464
If you really think that you can catch these sons of bitches,

397
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:48,035
you do whatever you have got to do to catch them.

398
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:51,106
If that means that you can't spend time with Frankie...

399
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:54,942
I will explain it to him,

400
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:57,377
and we're gonna wait for you.

401
00:43:57,379 --> 00:44:00,981
This is a defining moment in your life.

402
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:03,050
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

403
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:04,787
Thank you, Mom.

404
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,088
She loved you so much.

405
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,323
Dad!

406
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:12,859
- Hey! Come here, buddy. - Give me a hug.

407
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,831
What're you doing here? Are we going to Disneyland today?

408
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:18,899
No, buddy. Not today.

409
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,736
Did you catch the bad guys already?

410
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,238
No... but I will.

411
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,775
I know, you're Batman.

412
00:44:28,978 --> 00:44:30,277
Go play with your friends, okay?

413
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:31,280
Okay.

414
00:44:32,314 --> 00:44:33,849
I love you, buddy. Go ahead.

415
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,453
Yeah?

416
00:46:19,455 --> 00:46:22,322
We just received a call from a woman named Amanda Tyler.

417
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,358
She claims a man's been stalking her,

418
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,293
watching her from his car for days now.

419
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:27,662
What the fuck does that have to do with me?

420
00:46:27,664 --> 00:46:29,529
Amanda Tyler is on the list you gave me.

421
00:46:29,531 --> 00:46:31,632
So what, do you work in Dispatch now, Captain?

422
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:33,467
I asked to be informed of anything

423
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:35,202
that comes up about the women on your list.

424
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:37,304
So you did tell the Commissioner about this?

425
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:38,706
Why would I do that?

426
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,275
This is just between you and me.

427
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,976
You're there right now, aren't you?

428
00:46:42,978 --> 00:46:44,612
Of course I am.

429
00:46:44,614 --> 00:46:46,546
Are you staking out all these women?

430
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:49,082
Well, the best I can with a one-man army.

431
00:46:49,084 --> 00:46:50,618
Imagine if someone found out

432
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,386
you were doing illegal police surveillance?

433
00:46:52,388 --> 00:46:55,355
Look, I'm doing this mostly on my free time, okay?

434
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:58,492
Yeah, tell that to the jury. You gotta leave her be, Jeff.

435
00:46:58,494 --> 00:47:00,062
At least for the time being.

436
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:01,897
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,968
Are you fucking kidding me?

438
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:11,039
Okay.

439
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,528
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone.

440
00:47:46,508 --> 00:47:48,008
Jeff, it's no use.

441
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,410
Kelly, listen to me. Send backup here.

442
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,145
- Right away. - What are you talking about?

443
00:47:52,147 --> 00:47:53,246
They're here.

444
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:55,184
- Now? - Yes, right now. Do it.

445
00:48:30,753 --> 00:48:33,623
Hey! Don't fucking move!

446
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,996
Listen.

447
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:50,072
Put your hands behind your head. You too.

448
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:52,405
Do it!

449
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:53,576
Who's Elizabeth?

450
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:56,111
Drop the gun.

451
00:48:57,012 --> 00:48:59,414
- I said, drop your gun. - Do as he says.

452
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,518
You can still save her.

453
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:07,289
Now.

454
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:15,696
Turn around.

455
00:49:15,698 --> 00:49:17,266
- On your fucking knees. - Ow.

456
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:21,403
You didn't answer my question.

457
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:23,806
Who's Elizabeth?

458
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:25,706
My wife.

459
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,678
Detective Jeff Anderson. LAPD Homicide.

460
00:49:29,712 --> 00:49:31,444
Like Elizabeth Anderson.

461
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:32,847
Yeah, the painter.

462
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:34,715
You were so nervous about that one

463
00:49:34,717 --> 00:49:36,684
- because her husband was a cop. - Mmm.

464
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:38,351
Rightfully so.

465
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:39,720
I remember.

466
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:41,658
There was a young boy, too.

467
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,495
So we killed your wife.

468
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:50,432
How'd you know we'd be here?

469
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,634
I tried to think like you.

470
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:57,537
Well, you're just a regular Magnum PI, aren't you, Detective Anderson?

471
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,205
All right, I'm sick of this shit.

472
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:00,342
Wait!

473
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:10,853
They're here!

474
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:26,535
You need help.

475
00:50:27,837 --> 00:50:29,436
Okay, okay.

476
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:31,239
You're gonna be okay.

477
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:34,677
This is the way out of here.

478
00:50:37,714 --> 00:50:38,813
It's all right.

479
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:43,851
Stop right there!

480
00:50:49,257 --> 00:50:52,461
Don't go back to the house. We go with the contingency plan, take off.

481
00:51:50,352 --> 00:51:52,787
Mark Witver, freelance building contractor,

482
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:55,223
who was married to Felicia Connor, deceased.

483
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:58,458
She committed suicide.

484
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,896
Same bathroom setup as the victims.

485
00:52:00,596 --> 00:52:02,596
And the young one is their son?

486
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:05,300
Adam Witver. He was five when his mother killed herself.

487
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,369
Five.

488
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:26,488
House is clear, Captain, but you gotta take a look at the basement.

489
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:36,465
Watch your step.

490
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:04,352
Jeff... I'm so sorry.

491
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:06,689
We shouldn't have doubted you.

492
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:10,059
It's okay.

493
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,662
Your hands were tied.

494
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,645
We need to find your son.

495
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:07,882
You need to find my son.

496
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:09,018
Count me out of it.

497
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,953
Family's everything. Right, Jeff?

498
00:55:12,955 --> 00:55:14,255
Yeah.

499
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:18,025
So what is it with you? Why don't you tell me your story?

500
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:19,161
I want to hear it.

501
00:55:22,665 --> 00:55:24,698
Well...

502
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,703
Roll out the old family tree, my father...

503
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:30,638
Well...

504
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,640
He was long gone by the time I was born.

505
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:34,008
My mother raised me alone.

506
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,477
I was a difficult little shit.

507
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,247
I think I resented her for my father not being around.

508
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,715
But, any case,

509
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:45,955
raising me alone turned out to be way too fucking much for her to handle.

510
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:49,623
She killed herself...

511
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,726
when I was nine.

512
00:55:52,762 --> 00:55:55,896
Found her in the bath, drowning in her own blood.

513
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:58,799
And right next to her, there was an empty bottle of sleeping pills.

514
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:02,636
And I remember reading a notice again and again...

515
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:05,440
trying to find an explanation for what happened to her.

516
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:12,146
One of my mother's friends reached out to Child Services

517
00:56:12,148 --> 00:56:14,682
and offered to take care of me.

518
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:20,287
It turns out, she thought that I had driven my mom... crazy.

519
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:22,658
Crazy enough to take her own life.

520
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:29,029
So, she decided that she had to put me back on the right track,

521
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:30,532
which included...

522
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:34,704
beatings and unjust punishments.

523
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:38,672
Humiliations.

524
00:56:38,674 --> 00:56:40,641
I took things into my own hands.

525
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:42,142
Captain?

526
00:56:42,144 --> 00:56:46,580
One morning, I called the police, I was 12 or something.

527
00:56:46,582 --> 00:56:48,150
And I told them...

528
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:51,087
"I found her dead in the bathtub."

529
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,760
Never felt better in my whole life.

530
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,130
Why are you telling me all this?

531
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,634
You think that justifies what you did to these women?

532
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:08,004
Huh?

533
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:10,505
To my wife?

534
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,241
I'm telling you this because...

535
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:17,745
I respect you for being smart enough to get me here.

536
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:20,583
I want you to understand who I am.

537
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:22,585
And two...

538
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:25,853
By tomorrow, I'll be out of here.

539
00:57:25,855 --> 00:57:27,723
And you'll never hear from me again.

540
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,091
Wow, is that a fact?

541
00:57:31,093 --> 00:57:35,095
You don't think we do what we do without a contingency plan,

542
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:36,098
do you, Detective Anderson?

543
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,939
Jeff, you need to come with me.

544
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,873
Now.

545
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:46,976
Here we go.

546
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:50,846
What?

547
00:57:56,185 --> 00:57:58,052
Jeff...

548
00:57:58,054 --> 00:57:59,188
What are you doing here?

549
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,449
Where are we going?

550
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:04,885
I told you. Your dad wanted me to pick you up.

551
00:59:04,887 --> 00:59:05,986
I'm his new partner.

552
00:59:05,988 --> 00:59:08,055
So we're going to see Dad?

553
00:59:08,057 --> 00:59:09,825
- Absolutely. - Cool.

554
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:13,127
Why didn't Grandma come with us?

555
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:16,096
She had to run some errands. Don't worry.

556
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:18,365
Meantime, we can have some fun just the two of us, right?

557
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:19,368
Come on.

558
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,070
Left.

559
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:28,777
21.

560
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:44,358
- We don't have a choice. - You know how this works.

561
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,492
Hey, they have Frankie!

562
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:48,195
You're asking me to release a fucking serial killer!

563
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:49,830
- Listen to yourself! - What is wrong with you?

564
00:59:49,832 --> 00:59:52,099
We will play him. Plant a tracker.

565
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:53,901
And what if he gets rid of the bug?

566
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:56,970
What if they kill Frankie anyway?

567
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:01,008
Let's just go in there and get something out of Mark.

568
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,877
'Cause he will be over the fucking moon to help us.

569
01:00:05,347 --> 01:00:07,381
Where the fuck are they?

570
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:09,917
Uh-oh. What has Adam done now?

571
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:11,485
- He took my son. - Frankie?

572
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,155
Wow, they grow up so fast!

573
01:00:16,091 --> 01:00:17,457
Stay over there.

574
01:00:17,459 --> 01:00:19,828
Good. I'm good.

575
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,897
Mr. Witver.

576
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:24,133
Mr. Witver!

577
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:28,435
I'm Captain Alderman, and I'm the officer in charge here.

578
01:00:28,437 --> 01:00:30,337
What, female police captain?

579
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:32,306
Wow.

580
01:00:32,308 --> 01:00:35,475
You don't see that every day.

581
01:00:35,477 --> 01:00:38,178
Wait a minute. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

582
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,249
Now, if I remember correctly, when we got interested

583
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:46,922
in your wife, you were studying for the whole captain thing.

584
01:00:47,957 --> 01:00:49,158
So that means...

585
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:52,526
She took your job?

586
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:55,862
You better make sure your balls are still attached.

587
01:00:55,864 --> 01:01:00,100
Look, if you cooperate with us, and help us find his son,

588
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:02,069
we'll convince the DA to take it into account.

589
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:05,806
And they'll knock a couple of hundred years off my prison term?

590
01:01:05,808 --> 01:01:08,911
Please, bad Captain. Let me give you the lay of the land.

591
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:11,378
We'll give him back his son

592
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,448
in exchange for my immediate release from this shithole.

593
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,250
You know perfectly well that's not gonna happen.

594
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:18,552
Well, then you're gonna have to buy a small wooden box.

595
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:20,120
Motherfucker... You're gonna die.

596
01:01:20,122 --> 01:01:21,388
- Jeff! - You know that?

597
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,489
Jeff...

598
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:25,125
All right, Jeff, what are you gonna do?

599
01:01:25,127 --> 01:01:28,228
You gonna shoot me right here? That'll be perfect.

600
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,030
That'll end well for you.

601
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:32,833
Think for one fucking second. I die, he dies.

602
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:34,001
You understand me?

603
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:35,337
Jeff...

604
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:37,439
Put it down.

605
01:01:38,507 --> 01:01:41,074
What's gonna happen.

606
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:44,444
You're gonna get out of here, and I'm gonna get my son.

607
01:01:44,446 --> 01:01:46,515
Back off, Madam Captain, back off!

608
01:01:52,554 --> 01:01:55,489
You two are gonna walk me right out of here.

609
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:56,992
You understand?

610
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:59,061
Let's go.

611
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:00,529
I'm sorry.

612
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:07,303
Go ahead, Jeff.

613
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:11,140
Move.

614
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:43,370
Car keys, Jeff.

615
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:44,538
The car's at the crime scene.

616
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,841
Madam Captain?

617
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:53,046
You know, I feel for you, Jeff.

618
01:02:53,048 --> 01:02:55,482
I took your wife, this woman took your job.

619
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:57,451
You got nothing left.

620
01:02:57,453 --> 01:02:59,622
The least I could do is give you back your job.

621
01:03:02,391 --> 01:03:04,093
- I'm gonna... - Think about your son!

622
01:03:06,528 --> 01:03:08,030
- Back off. - Yeah?

623
01:03:08,397 --> 01:03:09,496
Fuck you.

624
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:42,262
When is my dad coming?

625
01:03:42,264 --> 01:03:45,298
Soon. He just texted me to say he's running late.

626
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,069
He's always late.

627
01:03:49,138 --> 01:03:51,373
Kind of sucks that your dad is never there for you, huh?

628
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,041
I don't know.

629
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,643
My mom was like that.

630
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:57,212
I always hated her for it.

631
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:01,116
My mom died.

632
01:04:03,152 --> 01:04:05,653
Yeah, mine too.

633
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,456
Kind of seems like we got a lot in common.

634
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:12,161
I think we're gonna be buddies, you and I.

635
01:04:14,196 --> 01:04:15,230
A lot.

636
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:18,467
I never had many friends.

637
01:04:34,584 --> 01:04:37,585
Your wife didn't kill herself, did she?

638
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:41,789
When I met Felicia, I was just doing odd jobs for a living.

639
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,627
She, on the other hand, was finishing law school.

640
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:49,531
Love at first sight.

641
01:04:50,332 --> 01:04:53,099
Didn't think it through very much.

642
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,304
We married six months after we met.

643
01:04:57,206 --> 01:04:59,740
She then got a job at some fancy law firm,

644
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:02,375
and started to change from day fucking one.

645
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:03,979
I thought she was gonna leave me.

646
01:05:04,814 --> 01:05:06,482
But she got pregnant.

647
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:09,051
That's right.

648
01:05:10,085 --> 01:05:11,619
After Adam was born,

649
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:16,289
we thought that it would put some cement into the cracks of our marriage,

650
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,594
but instead, it just...

651
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,730
started some sort of unhealthy competition

652
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:26,368
between her career and our family.

653
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:29,104
So you killed her.

654
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:31,674
I enjoyed every second of it.

655
01:05:33,275 --> 01:05:35,645
And that was the start of a very long series.

656
01:05:38,113 --> 01:05:39,548
I like to think my mother was.

657
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:49,057
Stop.

658
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:56,532
This is where you get out, buddy.

659
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,499
Just tell me where my son is.

660
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,569
How would I know?

661
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:03,871
I wanna see him, now.

662
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:08,174
Calm down. I'll release him as soon as I find Adam.

663
01:06:08,176 --> 01:06:10,143
- You have my word. - That wasn't the fucking deal.

664
01:06:10,145 --> 01:06:11,746
That was exactly the fucking deal.

665
01:06:11,748 --> 01:06:13,515
You release me, I release Frankie.

666
01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:15,783
Call Adam. Do it, now.

667
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:19,419
Jeff, you're not putting this together, see?

668
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:20,790
I'm the one calling the shots here.

669
01:06:25,227 --> 01:06:26,727
Are you kidding me?

670
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:29,064
Did you really think I was gonna let you go?

671
01:06:32,902 --> 01:06:34,804
Get Adam on the phone. Do it.

672
01:06:35,772 --> 01:06:36,773
Now!

673
01:06:45,314 --> 01:06:47,682
- Dad. - Adam. It's me.

674
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:51,520
I'm being, uh, detained... by our old friend, Detective Anderson.

675
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:55,157
But you stick to the plan. You keep that boy...

676
01:06:56,158 --> 01:06:57,359
Adam. Hey.

677
01:06:58,327 --> 01:06:59,328
Fuck!

678
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:02,832
Okay.

679
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,200
Your rules.

680
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:07,269
What's going on?

681
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:12,940
Your dad called. Unfortunately, he can't make it.

682
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:15,243
Why did you call him "Dad"?

683
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,411
Just a little joke...

684
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:20,715
that we have between each other.

685
01:07:20,717 --> 01:07:23,918
- Can I talk to him? - No, he's busy.

686
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,354
You know how he gets.

687
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:28,756
Can we go back to Grandma's house?

688
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:30,858
- I don't like this place. - Fuck it, Frankie,

689
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,928
your grandma asked me to take care of you until tomorrow, okay?

690
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,330
She called you?

691
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:39,301
Why don't...

692
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:42,672
you swallow this?

693
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:47,742
Makes you get a good night's sleep.

694
01:07:47,744 --> 01:07:51,478
And then when you wake up tomorrow, I'll take you to your father. I promise.

695
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,215
Grandma told me never to accept anything from strangers.

696
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:57,918
I'm not a stranger. I'm your dad's partner, remember?

697
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,654
Then show me your police badge.

698
01:07:59,656 --> 01:08:01,287
I don't have it with me right now.

699
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:02,625
And I don't believe you.

700
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,227
This is my gun.

701
01:08:07,229 --> 01:08:08,497
Do you believe me now?

702
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:18,808
Good boy.

703
01:09:15,765 --> 01:09:17,564
What now?

704
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,767
I'm gonna text you an address, you're gonna come right away and you're gonna bring my son.

705
01:09:19,769 --> 01:09:21,570
You know what, you're getting ahead of yourself.

706
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:26,676
You're a cop.

707
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,748
You killed my wife, and my partner. You took my son.

708
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,417
Do you think I give a fuck, a single fuck, about being a cop?

709
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:39,319
Dad, Dad, what do you want me to do here?

710
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:40,955
No matter how many times you hit me,

711
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:42,757
you're never gonna get us to do

712
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:44,627
anything we don't wanna do.

713
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:47,429
Really?

714
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:50,664
Okay. You asked for it.

715
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:51,667
No!

716
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:53,901
Dad! Dad!

717
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:55,803
I'm gonna text you an address,

718
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:58,505
and you're gonna be here in an hour.

719
01:09:58,507 --> 01:10:02,444
Jesus fucking Christ! Jesus fucking Christ!

720
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:08,584
That looks like it kinda hurts.

721
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,683
Doesn't it strike you that you and I are a lot alike?

722
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:45,152
I think you're losing blood to the brain.

723
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:47,520
I killed your wife, tore your life apart,

724
01:10:47,522 --> 01:10:50,390
you became obsessed and started living by that obsession.

725
01:10:50,392 --> 01:10:51,661
I made you, Jeff.

726
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:58,132
Just like the women in my life made me.

727
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:00,567
You're not gonna make it out of here alive. I want you to know that.

728
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:03,403
Let's see what Adam has to say about that.

729
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:04,974
Aren't you ashamed of what you made him?

730
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:08,008
I'm very proud of him.

731
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,879
Never forget, he grew up without a mother.

732
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:34,101
Where's Frankie?

733
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:35,137
You okay, Dad?

734
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:38,038
I'll live.

735
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,140
I wanna see my son, now.

736
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:42,209
You release my father, and I release Frankie,

737
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:43,611
it's as simple as that.

738
01:11:43,613 --> 01:11:44,680
Now!

739
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:49,683
By the way, we became good friends, Frankie and I.

740
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:51,819
We got a lot in common.

741
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:52,953
Don't you think I know what you're doing?

742
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,624
I don't buy your bullshit mind games.

743
01:11:56,558 --> 01:11:57,927
Get out of here, Adam.

744
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:02,029
Let me tell you what happens next.

745
01:12:02,031 --> 01:12:05,699
We part ways, Adam keeps Frankie...

746
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,969
you bring me before a jury and you let my lawyer go through

747
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:11,138
all the irregularities of my arrest.

748
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,608
I take my chances with the judge, and you lose your job.

749
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:20,480
In the meantime, Frankie gets to spend some quality time with Uncle Adam.

750
01:12:20,482 --> 01:12:22,016
He'll make an excellent apprentice.

751
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:24,820
He has the best possible background.

752
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,522
No! Stop!

753
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:33,029
I'm gonna keep counting, and each time I reach three, he loses another limb!

754
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:34,797
One!

755
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:36,699
Two!

756
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:39,967
Three!

757
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,869
Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

758
01:12:46,142 --> 01:12:48,010
You just killed your own son.

759
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:02,723
Dad! No!

760
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:04,792
Dad! You motherfucker, he was everything to me!

761
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:06,862
Tell me! Where's Frankie?

762
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:12,168
So you got nothing left to exchange, and I got nothing to fucking lose!

763
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:15,535
I guess that makes us dead men.

764
01:13:15,537 --> 01:13:18,040
Daddy! Please help me!

765
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,048
Help me!

766
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:54,677
Help me!

767
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:26,175
Fuck you! Fuck you!

768
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:01,043
Why?

769
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:04,647
Why did you help him kill all those women?

770
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:08,651
My father raised me that way.

771
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:13,689
So go ahead, do it.

772
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:15,991
Do it!

773
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:27,269
Daddy?

774
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:30,270
Do it!

775
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:34,376
- What are... What are you doing? - Frankie! Frankie, come here!

776
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:37,778
Okay. All right.

777
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,948
It's over. It's over.

778
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:41,350
Okay? Okay.

779
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:44,918
It's okay, buddy.

780
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,787
I'm gonna put you in the car, okay?

781
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,922
I just need you to go in the car.

782
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:52,259
All right? And put your seatbelt on for me. Okay?

783
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:54,695
Yeah, good boy. Good boy.

784
01:15:54,697 --> 01:15:56,332
Just put that on. All right?

785
01:16:05,474 --> 01:16:06,942
I'll be right back.

786
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:09,745
Get up. Get up!

787
01:16:12,248 --> 01:16:13,649
Move. Move!

788
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:23,190
Your father was everything to you.

789
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,159
Let's see how you manage without him.

790
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:47,917
Why are you throwing it away?

791
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:51,987
I'm done with it, buddy, I don't need it anymore.

792
01:16:57,326 --> 01:16:58,694
Hey, Frankie, where are you going?

793
01:17:15,244 --> 01:17:18,078
You catch bad guys, Dad. That's your job.

794
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,782
People need you.

795
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,460
Close the door.

796
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:34,294
Put your seatbelt on.

797
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:41,737
You ready?

798
01:17:42,905 --> 01:17:44,171
Let's go.

799
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,825
What, are you just gonna leave me here?

800
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:36,992
I love you.
