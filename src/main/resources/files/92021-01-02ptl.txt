1. The topic in PLT that I find helpful to me is the topic of law of attraction. According to the video that we watched, Law of attraction is attracting everything positive or negative depends on the situation of our mind, it simply transforming your thoughts into reality. Everything that we want can actually become ours if we will settle our mind of focus our thinking to that thing. Some of its supporting ideas are related to the Secret, secret in life, in money, of relationships, and etc... One best example of law of attraction is that if you really want to buy you own dream house, you need to make that dream the center of your life, you need to focus, and attract more positive vibes from the universe though sometimes you will encounter downs, but you must never lose sight from your dream, Law of attraction talks about the universe is listening ang will answer to you, depends on what you really want. If think negatively, the universe will answer negatively, but if you think positively, then positive will happen into your life. As a PN scholar and as a person, I always have goals and dreams, Law of attraction helps me think positively, it helps me think that I can get whatever I want if I settled my mind ang make that thing the center of my life. Though I know that I will takes time, but still, if I want to my dreams and goal to come true, I just need to live for it, and the time comes that I will not notice that all the things that I want have been granted.


3. Professionalism is an act of doing things right, like doing things in a right way and to the right path without sacrificing important matters. Professionalism is always on the ground, walking to be a successful, without stepping on others. It a way of doing things, efficiently, balance, and enjoyable without hurting others.
